\label{sec:discussion}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Better measurements using log sweeps (spectrogram plot a chirp vs log chirp)
	\item Investigation of weird sound at high volume when measuring. Maybe the missing peak from Cabinet plots?
	\item How hard will it be to implement bass reflex?
	\item Could the transfer functions be used for anything? Yes, see optimization of filters.
\end{itemize}
