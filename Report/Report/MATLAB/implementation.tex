\section{Implementation}
\fxnote{Possibly example of a class and description of it. Mostly ref to appendix for code. Example of output, maybe compared to other output.}
The \mintinline{matlab}{DriveUnit} class is shown below for clarification. The overall structure is a standard Matlab class inheriting from TransferFunctions, as shown in \cref{fig:classbdd}. Following are the private and public properties and the public methods, including the implementation of the \mintinline{matlab}{transform(f)} method.
