\section{Analysis}
The framework must include a speaker consisting of a drive unit and a closed cabinet, should include a crossover filter and could include a bass reflex, according to the \nameref{sec:delimitations}.
The frequency response of each unit should be exposed 
for investigation and the frequency response of the entire system must be available, to compare it to the measurements of real speakers.
