\chapter{Process}
This chapter describes the way the group has worked to complete the project and describes the overall working structure used in the project.
Early in the process a roadmap for the different phases of the project was produced. This was done to give the group an overview of the entire process. The roadmap is shown in \cref{tab:timeline}.

\section{Planning}
Early in the process we decided to make a plan consisting of several deadlines, to ensure the project is moving forwards.

\begin{itemize}
	\item[2018-04-13] Approval of project.
	\item[2018-04-23] Overview of transfer functions required. Function prototypes.
	\item[2018-04-30] Unit, cabinet and crossover classes.
	\item[2018-05-07] Unit, cabinet and crossover transfer functions. 
	\item[2018-05-14] Measure known speaker transfer function. 
	\item[2018-05-30] Report.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item[MUST] Check correct transfer functions used (large(infinite) closed box for Drive Unit, Closed box for cabinet).
	\item[MUST] Check correct measurements have been made.
	\item[SHOULD] Build a crossover filter (any filter) and measure it.
	\item[COULD] Add bass reflex to Matlab model.
	\item[COULD] Compare bass reflex measurement with Matlab model
\end{itemize}
