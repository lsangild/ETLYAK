\section{Setup}
The measurement setup is shown in \cref{fig:meassetup}, showing the see-through speaker and the microphone placed \SI{1}{\metre} apart on-axis.

The setup has a distance of \SI{1}{\metre} to be able to look at the joined output, when the a bass reflex is inserted into the see-through speaker.
