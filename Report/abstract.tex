This project has aimed to create a Matlab framework able to predict frequency responses of speakers, with and without bass reflexes, based on Thiele/Small parameters and the size of the cabinet and bass reflex.

The models for the speaker, based on electrical, mechanical and acoustical analogies, are implemented in Matlab classes, split up into the entities speaker, cabinet, drive unit, crossover filter and bass reflex.

Testing the models was done by comparing them to measurements of real speakers with known values and volumes.

The models were able to predict the cut-off frequency and slope of a speaker placed in a cabinet to a satisfying degree.
